# Fixed: Game Hub Routing

## Problem
- Users visiting `https://hamsterhub.fun/` were seeing the Business Empire lobby instead of the GAME HUB selection screen
- The default page was not showing the game selection interface with the three game cards

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Root Route (`/`)
**File**: `src/app/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Redirected to /gamehub
router.push('/gamehub');
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Shows the GAME HUB selection screen directly
import HomePage from './home';
export default function Home() {
  return <HomePage />;
}
```

### 2. Updated Home Page (`/home.tsx`)
**File**: `src/app/home.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed state-based game selection
- Added Next.js routing with `useRouter`
- Business Empire card now redirects to `/gamehub`
- Stock Trading card shows placeholder (can be expanded later)

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
const handleGameSelect = (gameType: string) => {
  if (gameType === 'business-empire') {
    router.push('/gamehub');  // Goes to Business Empire lobby
  } else if (gameType === 'stock-trading') {
    // Placeholder for stock trading
    console.log('Stock trading selected');
  }
};
```

## Current User Flow

### 1. Visit `https://hamsterhub.fun/`
- âœ… Shows **GAME HUB selection screen** (3 game cards)
- âœ… User sees: Business Empire, Stock Trading Simulator, Add New Game

### 2. Click "Business Empire" Card
- âœ… Redirects to `https://hamsterhub.fun/gamehub`
- âœ… Shows **Business Empire lobby** (player name input, join game)

### 3. Click "Stock Trading Simulator" Card
- âœ… Currently shows placeholder (ready for future implementation)
