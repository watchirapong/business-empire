# Fixed: Routing Issue for Business Empire Game

## Problem
- Users visiting `https://hamsterhub.fun/gamehub` were seeing an empty page
- The default page was not showing the game interface
- Multiple servers were running on different ports causing confusion

## Root Cause
1. **Port Mismatch**: The .env file had `PORT=3001` but Nginx was configured to proxy to port 3002
2. **Development vs Production**: The server was running in development mode instead of production mode
3. **Multiple Server Instances**: Multiple Next.js servers were running on different ports

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Port Configuration
**Before:**
```env
PORT=3001
```

**After:**
```env
PORT=3002
```

### 2. Set Production Mode
**Before:**
```env
NODE_ENV=development
```

**After:**
```env
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Built Production Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Restarted Server in Production Mode
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run multiplayer
```

## Current Setup

### Server Configuration
- **Port**: 3002 (matches Nginx configuration)
- **Mode**: Production (serves built Next.js application)
- **Features**: 
  - Next.js application serving
  - Socket.IO for multiplayer
  - MongoDB integration

### Nginx Configuration
- **Domain**: `https://hamsterhub.fun`
- **Proxy**: All traffic â†’ `localhost:3002`
- **SSL**: Let's Encrypt certificate
- **Socket.IO**: Properly configured for WebSocket connections

### Routes Working
- âœ… `https://hamsterhub.fun/` â†’ Redirects to `/gamehub`
- âœ… `https://hamsterhub.fun/gamehub` â†’ Multiplayer game lobby
- âœ… Socket.IO connections working
- âœ… MongoDB persistence active

## Verification

### HTTP Response Headers
```bash
# Root domain
curl -I https://hamsterhub.fun/
# Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

# Game hub
curl -I https://hamsterhub.fun/gamehub
# Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

### Server Status
```bash
# Check if server is running on correct port
netstat -tlnp | grep 3002
# Output: tcp6 0 0 :::3002 :::* LISTEN [PID]/node

# Check MongoDB connection
systemctl status mongod
# Status: active (running)
```

```

### Rebuild Application
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Restart server
NODE_ENV=production npm run multiplayer
```

### Check Status
```bash
# Check server process
ps aux | grep "node.*server.js"

# Check port
netstat -tlnp | grep 3002

# Check MongoDB
systemctl status mongod
```

## Files Modified
1. `.env` - Updated PORT and NODE_ENV
2. `src/app/page.tsx` - Added redirect to /gamehub
3. `src/app/gamehub/page.tsx` - Created game lobby
