# âœ… ADD BUSINESS FUNCTIONALITY - FIXED!

## Problem Solved
Users were getting a client-side exception when trying to add a business in the Business Empire game.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a data type mismatch between arrays and Sets in the client-side code. The server was sending `submittedPlayers` and `readyPlayers` as arrays, but the client was trying to convert them to Sets without proper type checking.

## Solution Applied

### ðŸ”§ **Fixed Data Type Conversion**
Updated the client-side code to properly handle both arrays and Sets:

```typescript
// BEFORE (causing errors):
submittedPlayers: new Set(state.submittedPlayers || []),
readyPlayers: new Set(state.readyPlayers || []),

// AFTER (fixed):
submittedPlayers: new Set(Array.isArray(state.submittedPlayers) ? state.submittedPlayers : []),
readyPlayers: new Set(Array.isArray(state.readyPlayers) ? state.readyPlayers : []),
```

### ðŸ”§ **Fixed All Instances**
Updated all 4 locations in `src/components/MultiplayerGame.tsx` where this conversion happens:
1. `gameState` event handler
2. `investmentStarted` event handler  
3. `allPlayersSubmitted` event handler
4. `gameReset` event handler

### ðŸ”§ **Server Process Management**
- Removed old PM2 process that was running outdated code
- Started fresh server with updated code
- Server now running on port 3002 with latest fixes
